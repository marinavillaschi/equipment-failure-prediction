# Equipment Failure Prediction

This report aims to tackle equipment failure problems on operation of an FPSO vessel.

I'll be answering the following questions, as well as drawing insights and explaining the analysis throughout the nootebook.

1. Calculate how many times the equipment has failed.

2. Categorize equipment failures by setups configurations (preset 1 and preset 2).

3. Categorize equipment failures by their nature/root cause according to parameter readings (temperature, pressure, and others).

4. Create a model using the technique you think is most appropriate and measure its performance.

5. Analyze variable importance.
